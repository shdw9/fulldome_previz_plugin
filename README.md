# Fulldome Previsualization: Fulldome Addon for Unity USD
This repository contains the source code for the `Fulldome Previsualization in Unity` plugin.

It is an addon to the [Unity's USD package](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/usd-unity-sdk) and adds features that would create a fulldome camera to allow users to visualize USD scenes in fulldome in Unity.
